won't you celebrate with me
Lucille Clifton
1936 - 2010

wont you celebrate with me
what i have shaped into
a kind of of life? i had no model.
born in babylon
both nonwhite and woman
what did i see to be except myself?
i made it up
here on this bridge between
starshine and clay,
my one hand holding tight
my other hand; come celebrate 
with me that everyday
something has tried to kill me
and has failed.
